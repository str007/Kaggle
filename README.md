# Scott's Data Science Portfolio

This repository represents all of the data science-based projects that I have completed to date. It includes both supervised learning and unsupervised learning work. Datasets have been pulled from many sources, including Kaggle or by use of web scraping. Often, within each project, the feature set(s) will be inputted to several different model types. 

Feel free to look around and please reach out if you have any questions!
