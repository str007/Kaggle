# Scott's Data Science Portfolio

### Welcome

This repository represents all of the data science-based projects that I have completed to date. It includes both supervised learning and unsupervised learning work. Datasets have been pulled from many sources, including Kaggle or by use of web scraping. Often, within each project, the feature set(s) will be inputted to several different model types and I will provide my recommendation as to which model best solves our research question. Below is a quick description of each of the projects you will find in my portfolio.
